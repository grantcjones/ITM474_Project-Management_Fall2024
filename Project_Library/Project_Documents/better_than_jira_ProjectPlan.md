### 2. Describe the education program you will create:

The **Project Management and Skill Tracking Application** is a collaborative platform designed to help teams and individuals efficiently manage projects while simultaneously tracking skill development. The software allows users to create, assign, and manage tasks for both individual and group projects, offering a clear view of progress and milestones. In addition to project management, it features a skill tracking system that records the skills learned or improved during each step of the project. Users can monitor their growth, build skill portfolios, and gain recognition for their contributions.

**Target Demographic**:  
The application is primarily designed for students and Academic Teams. It can be highly beneficial for student groups working on academic projects (such as the CSE 310 project). It allows tracking both project milestones and skills acquired through each project phase, supporting collaborative learning and self-assessment.

### 5. Trello Board Setup:

Each member of your team should create an account on Trello ([https://trello.com](https://trello.com)). The team member assigned to be the Scheduler should create a board for the team project. Every team member should be invited to collaborate on the board. You must also invite your teacher to collaborate. In the board, you should provide the following 4 buckets or lists: **Not Started**, **Working**, **Blocked**, and **Completed**.

As a team, start to add cards to the **Not Started** list based on your understanding of the team project. Include tasks related to planning, researching, implementing requirements, and testing. Researching includes anything that you do not currently know how to do as well as the creation of prototypes. The scheduler should maintain this Trello board throughout the semester. You will need to add more cards/tasks and move existing cards/tasks to different columns as the project progresses.
